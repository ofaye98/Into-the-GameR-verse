Hello and welcome to our team's project: "Into the GameR-verse"! In this project we used this [dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023) which has games dating from 1980 to 2023 and provides information on each game such as release date, genre, and number of plays. 

We primarily wanted to know which games are users inclined to play over time and what are the trends in popularity for each genre. Since this dataset has curated about 1500 games over 43 years, we thought it would be interesting to see what captures a player's interest over the years.
