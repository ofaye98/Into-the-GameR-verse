Into the GameR-verse - Faye Orcales, Genevieve Akponye & Matt Suntay
Github Repo for PROPEL Spring 2023 Class Project: Exploring and Visualizing Data with R
 
Hello and welcome to our team's project: "Into the GameR-verse"! In this project we used this [dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/popular-video-games-1980-2023) which has games dating from 1980 to 2023 and provides information on each game such as release date, genre, and number of plays. 

We primarily wanted to know the trends in popularity across different game genres. Since this dataset had curated about 1500 games over 43 years, we thought it would be interesting to see what captures a player's interest over the years.

To see how we did everything (and try it for yourself!), we annotated our RMD file to have a step-by-step walk-through on how we parsed through the data, cleaned it up, and visualized it! If you have any questions on our RMD file or our analyses, feel free to reach out to us:
